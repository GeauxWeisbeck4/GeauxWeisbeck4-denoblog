# GeauxWeisbeck4.deno.dev

This is my blog, created from the [Deno Blog](https://github.com/denoland/deno_blog/) repository. I had other plans initially for this blog, but I now have decided to make this my official Deno Dev site. Currently I only have the blog, but I plan on implementing more features in the future. I'm going to link my Deno notes here, (pulled from LogSeq, possibly will create my own notes platform) and I will also create other pages with like tutorials and things of that nature. 

Currently my blog hosts a couple of important characters - the Judah Denosaur, who was my favorite stuffed animal growing up. The second is OG Deno, a Denosaur in the GamDeno Cyber Crime family of New York - don't let the infamy fool you, he's a good Denosaur. He just makes his living doing things that the government doesn't like.
