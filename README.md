# GeauxWeisbeck4-denoblog

This is my blog, created from the [Deno Blog](https://github.com/denoland/deno_blog/) repository. It was intended to be the blog for GeauxWeisbeck4.dev, but development of the second version of that website was pushed back so I now have this as a seperate blog. I will write about important stuff I guess - not sure exactly how I will implement it yet.

## To Use This Blog

Git clone this repository then run:

```
$ cd GeauxWeisbeck4-denoblog
$ deno task start
```

You should be good to go - don't forget to head over to the Deno Deploy platform to deploy your own blog!

Have fun!
