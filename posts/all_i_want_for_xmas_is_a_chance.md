# All I Want for Christmas is a Chance

So I have really struggled to find work since I was fired back on November 22, 2021 for a misunderstanding
that ended up getting fixed anyways. It has been a very challenging time for me and my partner as we have 
struggled to pay bills and to afford to even eat. I have honestly put in a lot of effort and have had an open 
mind about jobs, but the only one I was offered and worked was a waiting job which I left after 3 shifts because
it was hard to tdo while knowing I can do much better.

I don't know if it's my gap in employment or if people are seeing my DUI, but let me clear this up right now
then - 

#### I DID EVERYTHING I WAS SUPPOSED TO AND WAS LET OFF EARLY FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR.

North Carolina really screwed me around with the DUI, but I did handle everything and I haven't even drank since 
that incident. If this isn't why I'm getting passed over for so many jobs, then what else can it be?

## I'm Smart, Creative, and a Great Team Player

I'll quit talking about how it has destroyed me not having a job for a year and tell you why your team 
needs me. I am a very talented individual and even better than talent, I have a strong desire to constantly 
learn and upgrade my skills and knowledge at any opportunity I get. I've been programming for over 5 years
and have been coding daily for almost three years. I know I don't have many jobs to show for it, other than
some freelance clients. I haven't had a whole lot of them either because I've just been applying for jobs 
and learning to code and building things.

# My Promise

Maybe I'll catch a break and start getting steady freelance clients, but I really need a job. If you are an
employer, please give me a chance. I promise you will never encounter a harder worker than me. And if there 
is anything I don't know, I will pick it up very quickly. I promise that I will have a positive everyday when 
I start work and will do whatever I can to make me and my teammates better.

I've been coding 12-18+ hour days for the last year since I was fired from my job. I have no fear of long 
hours and love diversity. I miss working on a team and strongly desire to work together with people instead 
of approving my pull requests on GitHub all alone. 

I also need the pay badly - and not for me. My fiance has been working her ass off to just struggle paying our 
bills because of me not being able to get a job. I really need a dev job because I can't waste all of those 
long hours spent in front of the monitor learning Rust and JavaScript. I also need the pay to get our life back 
track. So I hope you please can understand why all I want for Christmas is a chance.

Give yourself a chance and hire somebody with a very high upside for your company. 

 Thank you!
