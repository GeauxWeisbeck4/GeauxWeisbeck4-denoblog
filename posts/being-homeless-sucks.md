# Being Homeless Sucks

Ever since we were told that we were going to lose our place, I knew we were not in for a smooth ride. It has not been at all and it as been almost hell every day since. Being homeless is hell. Let's look at some of the things that have happened that fucking suck:

- We lost the kitties
- We lost the car
- We have none of our stuff
- We have no money and have to panhandle for it
- No home still

It's hard not to want to give up you know.

## How to hold out hope

I'm holding out that we are talking to the legacy at 6 Forks and they said they are giving out free housing. That is a long shot but it is also 4/20.

Happy 4/20!
