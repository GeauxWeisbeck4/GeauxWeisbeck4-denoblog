# Being Stressed Out on the Holidays

So I am really stressed out this year around Christmas. Why? Well let's see:

- I haven't had a job all year and when I finally got one, it was too far away
  for me to get to, because reason number two why I'm stressed:
- I don't have a car. I haven't had a car in two years and it has really sucked
  and made it impossible to find work and get around.
- We have no money because a lot of it goes to Uber and the rest of it goes to
  this stupid apartment - oh yeah which is stress number four:
- We might get kicked out of our home again for the second time this year. We
  even had the money - we were just a couple hundred short, but they wanted
  everything at once! I just found out that I probably could have paid them and
  that sucks, because now we're afraid we don't have enough cause we paid other
  bills and are begging them to let us stay.
- I'm afraid to ask for help from people because we've asked a lot. But it has
  been warranted - I've been trying everything to get a job and just seem to
  have not been able to catch a damn break.

So that's why I'm stressed - potential homelessness, no work and I really want
to work (seriously, nobody will take me cause no car and nobody will give me a
chance as a developer yet even though I'm good at it), and there's even more
stuff I'm not bringing up here because it's not entirely appropriate or I don't
want to.

If anybody wants to help out, feel free too. But I at least could use some
prayers for me to catch a break - it's been a stressful, hard year.

Tanks for  istening.
