# Big Updates for 2023

So this will not be a super long post, but I just need to send out an update on what's been going on in my life in 2023. It's really not a whole lot of good unfortunately :(

## Evicted From Our Apartment

Maybe if you know me really well, you heard about this one. Basically, Sterling Glenwood (the slumlord) delivered us an eviction writ the day before they were going to bring the sheriff to evict us, and we thought we could still go down to the courthouse and get a stay order because somebody told us we could. We went to the judge who really didn't even give a shit about us, so we lost that and ran home because we figured the sheriff might be there... mother fuckers had animal control ready to take our pets away.

What sucks is that we kept trying to pay them and they wouldn't take our money. They really just wanted us gone because "we were poor". 

Since then, we've been homeless and it is getting worse by the day. 

## 50 Days of Projects

Watch out for this one as I am going to be creating a project a day for 50 days from here on out. You can find my posts on most of my social media accounts and on my [digital garden](https://andrewsdigital.garden). I am going to be adding donation buttons in case you like my work and help me find a way to become unhomeless once again. 

## Please Consider Us

Lisa and I are having a really difficult time right now. I can barely find time to work cause I'm always lugging around all our shit and trying to find a place to sleep, which usually has been the Jeep. It just sucks. 

Please consider praying for us if you think that will help or you can donate to us by contributing to my [Patreon](https://patreon.com/GeauxWeisbeck4dev?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link) or on my [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/geauxweisbeck4) pages. 

We are two hard working individuals who really do try to do the right thing, we just have had a lot more bad breaks than good breaks for a while and would both be extremely grateful for any type of thoughts, prayers, or help you can provide. 

Until next time...
