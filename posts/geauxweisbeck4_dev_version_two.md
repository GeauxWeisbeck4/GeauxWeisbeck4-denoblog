# Introducing GeauxWeisbeck4.dev Version 2.0!
![My new website](https://res.cloudinary.com/tar-heel-dev-studio/image/upload/v1670739105/geauxweisbeck4version2_zixpq0.png)

Well I've been meaning to make this happen for some time, but I can finally
announce it - GeauxWeisbeck4.dev Version Two is finally live! Yes, I actually
did it. It took months of starting and stopping, crying and laughing, but I
actually made the second version of my personal website and it is
oh-my-lord-so-much-better.

It really took me forever to pick out the tech stack. I really wanted to use
Next.js, but then after starting to use Deno this year, I knew I had to use
Deno. Then I had decide whether I wanted to use Fresh, Aleph.js, or Ultra.js but
then ultimately selected none of them and went with Lume. Lume ended up being
fantastic as it operates very similarly to my favorite SSG, Eleventy - well, I
suppose I'd say Lume is in that category, except they need to get their
community on the level that 11ty is on.

There were some challenging parts to the website to develop, namely the skills
progress bars that show my experience with each technology. I also had a hard
time with figuring out just how to style the website in general - I didn't
really do a layout like I should have in Figma because I was going to just "wing
it", which always seems to work out so well. It did in this case, kind of like
my old website, but really because I just kind of let myself go with the flow on
where Deno and Lume were taking me.

## Conclusion

To conclude my post about my new website, I wanted to announce that this blog
was chosen by myself to be the official GeauxWeisbeck4.dev Version Two blog! Oh
man, I'm so thrilled because I just gave myself the honors of blogging for my
own website - I never thought I would be in such a prestigious position to be
able to help myself out like this.

I don't want to spill too many beans on the details on how the website was made,
because that is the duty of my technical docs website,
[andrewweisbeck.tech](https://andrewweisbeck.tech/). I want y'all to head over
there and read more about how I created
[GeauxWeisbeck4.dev](https://geauxweisbeck4.dev) in detail - you can also find
many of my other projects on that site as well. It was made with
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), so it is super fun!

Thank you for reading this most recent blog post and I will have many more
coming out so check back in and say hi!
