# Introducing the OG Deno

![The Og Deno](static/ogdeno.png)

This is the OG (Original Gangster) Deno - I am going to submit him over to the [Deno Art Showcase](https://deno.land/artwork) to be displayed with his friends. OG Deno is one real mother f****er who doesn't take $#*@ from no one. Nobody knows what he's thinkin behind those cool, dark shades, but many people think he wears them because he got a contact stuck in his eyeball at a young age and his eye has never looked right since.

## Known Associates

They say OG Deno is known to kick it with [Judah](https://deno-avatar.deno.dev/avatar/29e6de.svg) - Judah is the fun lovin Deno on the home page of this blog. Judah is my Denosaur that my Dad brought home to me after his first date with my mom in Rapid City, South Dakota. He was my favorite forever, but I'll tell that whole story at another point in time because this is about the OG Deno. 

The OG Deno is also known to roll with the GamDeno Family. The GamDeno Family is a notorious cyber crime family in New York City, famous for the big Dinosaur Park Hack and also for hacking every Dinosaur Museum across the United States in a coordinated attack that allowed them to retrieve dinosaur bones from many high security facilties.

## OG's Skills, Family Ranking, Etc.

Rumor has it that OG Deno is the mastermind hacker of the family - nobody knows for certain though because he hasn't said a word when he's been pinched, and neither has any other GamDeno Family member. This leads us to believe he is a high ranking member, possibly the God Father of the family, but it may never be known as the GamDeno's are highly secretive, extremely skilled at hacking, and so fast that they will probably never be brought to justice.

We do know there was an attempt on his life by Russian Hackers, which was a deeply flawed attempt in which the Russian Hackers actually hacked themselves and set off a detonated fart machine which made them all pass out for an entire afternoon. Stories like this are common when you hear of anyone trying to get close to OG Deno. 

## What Else Do We Know About OG Deno?

We know that OG Deno loves to smoke hash - there is another theory to his shades. It is said that he is always so bombed off of his own stash, he has to wear those shades or his pupils would dialate so intensely that he would lose his eyesight. OG also loves to eat salads with Italian dressing at his favorite Italian joint - we believe that is [Sgt. Peffers in Omaha, Nebraska](https://www.sgtpeffers.com/). He flies in every week just to stop by and get his favorite dish of pasta and their wonderful salads.

He contributes a majority of his wealth to dinosaur fossil research. However, there are no tax records to confirm this. OG is so good at washing his money that he has shown zero income his entire life, allowing him to avoid ever filing taxes. It's like he's never existed on paper...

## Conclusion

If you see OG Deno, be sure to tell him he's a good boy and scratch his head. He's actually quite nice and he will probably kick his leg and wag his tail. You can also feed him some leaves and he'll likely leave you with a hefty tip - or some gnarly code. 

God bless the OG Deno.
