# Welcome to the Blog Page for GeauxWeisbeck4.dev!
![GeauxWeisbeck4.dev Blog](https://res.cloudinary.com/tar-heel-dev-studio/image/upload/v1670070683/GEAUXWEISBECK4logo4_qfksgg.png)

I'm excited to announce that GeauxWeisbeck4.dev now will have it's own official blog page while [andrewweisbeck.blog](https://andrewweisbeck.blog) will now be hosted as its own separate website. This is exciting for a few reasons:
 - This blog and the new Geauxeisbeck4.dev website are both created with Deno and the website features the Fresh framework!
 - Andrewweisbeck.blog is my daily "6logging" journal, so to speak. It deserves its own website with tagging, search functionality, and some other cool features I'm cooking up. It will be pretty cool to see where the project is in 6 months as I'll be dealing with a massive amount of content by then. 

You may wonder why I didn't have a dedicated blog page to this website before? I didn't know as much then as I do now, when I was younger. I just thought that it looked normal to have a completely different URL pull up when you accessed my blog I guess? I also thought that all the random things I was blogging about would be beneficial to my GeauxWeisbeck4.dev portfolio site (it wasn't), so I was young and dumb then. I am only slightly older and still dumb.

## What else is up over there? It sounds like you are changing your whole portfolio site?

Yes! And it was a much-needed upgrade - believe me. I am developing this website on [Deno](https://deno.land), deploying it on [Deno Deploy](https://github.com/denoland/deployctl), and using the [Fresh Framework](https://fresh.deno.dev) for creating my new portfolio site. I hope you find this website enjoyable and my work interesting - I have all the right things in place. Now I just need to optimize the user experience!

## Ummmmm - So tell me how your coding this or something?

Well, I wouldn't say I can tell you how I am coding this, besides I am using Typescript, Deno and Fresh. My standards are high for the code I write. I follow the best practices of the [Air BnB JavaScript Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/), while integrating it with the best Typescript practices. I will get into the technology more later on, but I want to give you the reader a sense of the style and the high expectations I have for work I create. 

Honestly, I would not be surprised if there is a single other person who reads more than me in the whole world. I spend hours reading every day. Sometimes, I don't sleep for days because I am so into what I am reading (and sometimes creating) that I just keep going until I crash. The adrenaline for finishing the project kicks me back up and I continue until I am satisfied with my progress. I am never satisfied until I complete the version of the project I am working on, so this can be a long process that leaves me super satisfied for the time being.

## Geaux Agile Sprint Method

I always have way too many projects and ideas I want to get to, so I'm always staying busy with lots of different things, but doing so responsibly now. I had to learn some productivity skills around software and how to prioritize things. Through this productivity research and discovery, I decided that Agile is the best way for me to accomplish things and keep track of them. Document them. Deploy them. Write Stories.

My very own agile app is in the process of being planned out, but you can find the [Geaux Sprint Stackblitz Starter](https://geaux-stackblitz-sprint.netlify.app) here - it currently shows my sprint information but in the future that will be an easy-to-use starter template. I will also have plenty of literature on how to get the most out of my technology - with a thriving community, I should add. 

## There's a lot going on!

That's for damn sure. I would love to keep telling you about all the exciting things I have coming down the road, but I do need to get to coding. I'm sorry, coding takes precedence over all other activities so I can get back to building things that solve problems. 

Until next time friends.
